## Project
* The AR-Based Treasure Hunt application is a mobile app that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology for users to find "treasures" placed at specific coordinates. The app displays treasure points on a map and determines the user's distance and direction to the selected treasure. When the user is within 10 meters of a treasure point, they can see an AR treasure model and earn points by interacting with the model, increasing the number of treasures found. The user can track their captured treasure count and score on their profile page.

## Requirements
* Requires iOS device with A9 processor or newer.

## Technologies Used
* Swift
* UIKit
* ARKit
